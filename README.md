Py-V is a cycle-accurate simulator for RISC-V CPUs, written in pure Python. It is also a (WIP) library for designing and modelling any digital hardware.

## Why Py-V?

- _Yes, it won't be performant_
- **But**:
  - It's _not_ yet another RISC-V emulator: it implements an actual CPU down to _register-transfer level_ (RTL)
  - Cycle-accurate
  - Helps to learn about CPU architecture
    - Like a real hardware design, the CPUs are made from different modules that are connected with each other
  - Python makes writing core models faster
- I started doing this more as an experiment, to design an easy to use "hardware prototyping framework" with an integrated simulator
  - A CPU was an obvious choice to test this idea
  - Py-V can be used for _rapid prototyping_: High-level design flexibility by leveraging the language features of Python, with the possibility to go as low-level as Verilog/VHDL
    - Similar projects are [PyRTL](https://ucsbarchlab.github.io/PyRTL/), [MyHDL](https://www.myhdl.org/), [nMigen](https://github.com/m-labs/nmigen), and [PyMTL](https://github.com/pymtl/pymtl3)
  - I have not yet planned on how to convert a Py-V model into Verilog/VHDL, but that might be something interesting for the future
  - Once the hardware modelling framework behind Py-V is mature enough, I am planning to migrate it to a new, separate library, and Py-V will just use the new library.
    - For now, if you want to use the library to design your own systems follow the steps [below](#designing-your-own-systems)

## Core models

As of now, there are the following core models:

- Classic 5-stage RISC CPU (`SingleCycle`)
  - Single-cycle
  - 8 KiB memory

## Running a test program

**Prerequisites**:

- RISC-V toolchain
- python3

First, navigate to the `programs` directory, and compile the programs:

```
make
```

Then, navigate back to the top-level directory, and start the simulation by running:

```
python3 main.py
```

By default, this will simulate the `fibonacci` and `loop_acc` test programs. The output should look something like this:

```
$ python3 main.py
===== LOOP_ACC =====
* Creating core instance...
* Loading binary...
* Starting simulation...

Simulation done at cycle 3000 after 0.11450981599773513s.

x1 = 1000
x2 = 1000
x5 = 4096
pc = 0x20
mem@4096 =  ['0xe8', '0x3', '0x0', '0x0']

===== FIBONACCI =====
* Creating core instance...
* Loading binary...
* Starting simulation...

Simulation done at cycle 3000 after 0.12019554300059099s.

Result =  ['0x37', '0x0', '0x0', '0x0']
```

_Note_: The simulation times can vary from machine to machine. Also, in the meantime (as of Jan 2022), I added logging which could additionally slow down the simulation. There still some work to do when it comes to runtime optimiztions!

### Adding custom programs

You can add your own programs by following the examples in `programs/`. To simulate, refer to `main.py` to see how the example programs are run. I know that having a command line interface here would be nice, but I didn't have time to implement that, but it's definitely on my wishlist!

## Feature wishlist

Unordered (and probably incomplete) list of things I plan to integrate in the (near) future:

- [ ] Pipelined core model
- [ ] Exceptions
  - Partial support implemented
- [ ] Branch predictor
- [ ] Caches
- [ ] ...

## Designing your own systems

Py-V also contains a library that can be used to model any digital hardware at RTL level. Although detailed documentation is currently underway, you can get started by cloning this repository and examining the examples in `pyv/stages.py` and `pyv/models`.

Py-V is structured around the following building blocks:

- **Modules**: Fundamental units of design encapsulating various hardware elements.
  - Analogous to Verilog modules
- **Ports**: Input and output interfaces connecting modules.
- **Wires**: To connect ports
  - Ports can also be connected *directly* without the need of a wire object (see examples)
- **Registers**: Storage elements that capture and hold data.
  - Yes, Py-V has *actual* register objects!
- **Memories**: As the name suggests.

Py-V currently supports one implicit global **clock**. On each clock tick, all registers and memories within the design are synchronized.

Please refer to the API documentation for more information: https://kyaso.github.io/py-v/.

## Under the hood

This section is intended to explain how Py-V (and the language behind it) works internally. ðŸš§ I am still working on a proper documentation for Py-V, so currently there is no ETA on when this section will be finished.

On the other hand, you can have a look into the source code as I tried to reduce complexity as much as possible, so the code should be almost self-documenting (otherwise please let me know!).

### Source files

`pyv/`. This is the package where the source files of Py-V are located.

- `clocked.py`: Contains base definitions of all clocked elements (e.g., memories, registers)
- `defines.py`: Contains common definitions, constants, etc.
- `isa.py`: Contains definitions for RISC-V ISA (opcodes, etc.)
- `log.py`: Contains a basic logger
- `mem.py`: Contains a simple behavioral memory model
- `models/`: Contains different core models
  - `model.py`: Base class for core models
  - `singlecycle.py`: A basic 5-stage single-cycle RISC-V CPU
- `module.py`: Abstract base class for all modules
- `port.py`: Contains definitions for ports (Inputs, Outputs, Wires)
- `reg.py`: Contains definitions for registers
  - Also defines register file
- `simulator.py`: Contains the simulator
- `stages.py`: Module definitions for the various pipeline stages
- `util.py`: Contains helper functions, and variables/constants

`test/`. Here you can find [pytest](pytest.org)-based unit tests.

`programs/`. This directory contains test programs that can be compiled, and later executed on a core model.

- `common/`: Common source files needed for compiling
- `endless_loop/`: As the name suggests
  - Execution time is limited in `main.py` (see below)
- `fibonacci/`: A non-recursive version of the Fibonacci algorithm.
- `loop_acc/`: An assembly program that counts from 0 to 1000.

`main.py`. Main execution file

- Runs simulation using compiled binaries from `programs/`

`doc/`. Contains documentation resources.
